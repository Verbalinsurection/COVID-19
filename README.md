# COVID-19

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/de18f53129264c3081b816658d50708e)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/t.stassinopoulos/COVID-19?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Verbalinsurection/COVID-19&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Download, convert and load COVID-19 information into influxdb.
This "app" will load the CSV of Covid-19 and convert them for loading into an influxDB.
As the source is being updated once a day, you should run this app three times a day.
In addition, I would recommend using appNew.js. The reason for that is the issue with the recovered figures from JHU.

# Update 04 April 2020
Clean up and adding fields of appNew.js and ccp.json. The db structure has been extended by daily new confirmed, deaths, and recovered as well added ISO 3166 alpha-2, lat, long, and geohash.

fields:

  Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, ConfirmedNew, DeathsNew, RecoveredNew, Population
  
tags:

  isocode_2, isocode, latitude, longitude, geohash, country, region
